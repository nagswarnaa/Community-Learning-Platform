Project Name: Community Learning Platform

Project Description:

Build a Community Learning Platform where people can post and share educational content such as articles, video links, tutorial guides, coding snippets, and quizzes. This platform will facilitate community-driven learning and promote knowledge sharing among users.

Project Components:

Frontend - React: Create a user-friendly, dynamic, and responsive UI. The frontend should include features like user registration/login, posting/sharing of content, content filtering, user profiles, a comment system, and a rating/review system for shared content.

Backend - Spring Boot: Set up the backend to handle various operations such as user authentication, data management, and search functionality. You can use Spring Security for user authentication and Spring Data JPA to manage data.

Database - MySQL: Design a robust database schema to store various information such as user details, shared content details (articles, links, guides), comments, ratings/reviews, etc.

Version Control - Git: Use Git for version control. It will help in tracking changes, revert to previous versions if required, and enable effective collaboration if you are working in a team.

CI/CD Pipelines: Implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate the process of integrating your changes into the main codebase and deploying the application to production. Tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions can be used for setting up these pipelines. Automating these processes will help in detecting bugs/errors early and reducing the time to deliver updates to the users.

Testing: Include a robust testing system with both unit tests (using tools like JUnit for the backend and Jest for the frontend) and integration tests to ensure the functionality of your application.

Advanced Features:

Notification System: A notification system to alert users when new content is posted, someone comments on their posts, or when they receive a reply on their comments.

Content Recommendation System: Use machine learning algorithms to recommend personalized content based on a user's interaction history and interests.

Community Moderation: Implement a reporting system and moderation features for the community to self-regulate and maintain a positive learning environment.

Social Login: Allow users to register/login using their social media accounts like Google, Facebook, etc.

This project encompasses a wide range of technologies and techniques, which will provide a deep understanding of how modern full-stack web applications are built. It will be a significant addition to your portfolio. -
